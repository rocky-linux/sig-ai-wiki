# About SIG/AI

Rocky Linux supports all the necessary software to run an AI training/inference stack on it, including, but not limited to:

* AI frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and JAX
* Important programming languages for AI like Python, R, Julia, or Go
* Container solutions like Docker and Apptainer
* Container orchestrations platforms likle Kubernetes and its various distros

Some of these already fall under the purview of the other SIGs, so in SIG/AI, we are primarily focused for the moment on ensuring that the first of these, the AI frameworks, are compatible with Rocky Linux and can be executed on the latest versions of RL8 and RL9.
